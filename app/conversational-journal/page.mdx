# Conversational Journal: Mock release

> ### ‚òÄÔ∏è Have a good day

## The press release

([Not a real one](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/an-insider-look-at-amazons-culture-and-processes) - and a work in progress)

#### What do you get when you cross a journal, a therapist, and ChatGPT?
We don‚Äôt have an answer for you, but we do have more questions‚Ä¶

We are pleased to announce the **Conversational Journal**, a tool designed to help people reflect more deeply and act more intentionally. 

Unlike traditional journals or simple chatbots, the Conversational Journal remembers and integrates all previous conversations to ask the most incisive questions every day.

#### Bring your own goals

Let what matters to you, direct the journal‚Äôs conversation. The 5 minute onboarding will set your journal up for day 1.  The journal gets better as it learns each day - and so do you!

#### Bring your own productivity tools (or use ours)

You can‚Äôt talk your way to a good day. The app turns reflections into actions items. Tick the resulting todos off on our platform, or yours - whether it‚Äôs Notion or Motion.

#### Bring your own therapist (or use ours) (or not)

 ‚ÄúSo - how have you been?‚Äù. Let your journal prime your therapy or coaching session better than you ever could, with a neat email summary, including excerpts, data driven aggregations, and questions to dive into. And it goes both ways - therapists can also prime the way the journal interacts with you every morning, and curate your on-demand-menu-of-helpful-exercises.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Do I have to use the journal every day? I‚Äôm busy - how long does it take?

15 minutes at the top of your weekday mornings is üëå. Speaking is faster than typing, so try dictating a stream of consciousness (your journal will clean it up). If you miss a few days, you‚Äôll live, and so will your journal. 

#### Wait - how does conversational journalling actually work?
Every day, the the journal starts out by asking what‚Äôs on your mind (of course, like everything else, this is customisable). Welcoming your thoughts and feelings in, and designing around them, is better than leaving them festering outside - until they inevitably barge in and wreak havoc‚Ä¶right? 

After digesting your raw thoughts and feelings - the journal hits you with 3 probing questions. 

Could you reframe something? Are you avoiding a deeper question? Have we seen this movie before? Answering them helps you to refine and integrate your thoughts.

Then, the journal also helps you prioritise - starting all the way from your top line goals, instead of just copy pasting that which is inevitably left undone. 

So you leave the session feeling like your thoughts, the world, and your plan for the day - are all beautifully and robustly aligned. 

#### How can I trust you with my most intimate information?

Don‚Äôt. We literally couldn‚Äôt read your journal - even if we wanted to. Your entries are encrypted end-to-end with your PIN, that we never see. We open source all code that touches anything remotely sensitive. In short: trust the math, not us.

#### Why don‚Äôt I just talk to chatgpt?

You can - and that works well well. As a conversational journal - this works better. ChatGPT is great at answering questions - but the journal is better at asking them.  To select the most incisive questions, the journal manages its long term memory of your previous days, weeks, and years with an algorithm tailored to this purpose.

#### How does it integrate with other productivity tools like Notion?

Conversational Journal connects seamlessly with Notion and similar applications, actively pulling context, insights, and tasks from those tools, and sending structured tasks and reflections back. 

#### How does my therapist figure out how to tag team with my journal?

If they‚Äôre your therapist, and new to the journal - as long as they can read an email at the start of every session with you, they can get started. We have a free training course for them to get the most out of it, from there. If you use a therapist from our panel - of course they‚Äôre already dialed all the way in (so much so that we build the product collaboratively with them!)

#### What about integrating real time data from wearables?

It‚Äôs on the roadmap!

### Hey :) 

I’m Arjun. Here’s a little about me. I’d love to learn about you!

### I'm on a sabbatical after a decade on my startup

I dropped out of college (bioinformatics research), to build Kandua, which we sold to South Africa's biggest insurer.

  <div className="space-y-4">
    <p>We built probably-too-many products to get these guys jobs and run their businesses.</p>

    <p>All 50+ of us were so bought in to the mission. I loved that. I especially loved doing it all with [my cofounder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayo-folawiyo-4919b160/?originalSubdomain=uk).</p>

    <p>I did whatever felt most pressing (engineering, then also product).</p>

### I want to dabble on fun problems with people

I’m interested in:

- AI - like [this](https://asterisk.chat)
- Infrastructure to make the web more participatory (like this)
- Things that Make the World a Better Place™

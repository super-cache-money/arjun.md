### Hey!

I'm Arjun (Khoosal). Here's a little about me :)

### I'm on a sabbatical after a decade on my startup

I bailed early on [becoming an academic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UGUQ_WsAAAAJ&hl=en) to build [Kandua](https://kandua.com/-/about), which we sold to South Africa's biggest insurer. We built probably-too-many-products to get these guys jobs and run their businesses. Unfortunately, they still stand outside hardware stores.

All 50+ of us were so bought in to the mission. [I loved that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GROztu3bu9g). I especially loved doing it all with [my cofounder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayo-folawiyo-4919b160/?originalSubdomain=uk). I did whatever felt most pressing (engineering, then also product).

### I want to dabble on fun problems with people

I'm most interested in LLMs, and Making The World A Better Placeâ„¢. 

I started dabbling with a [conversational journal](/conversational-journal), which led to the broader need for [encrypted, portable LLM memory](https://asterisk.chat), which led to the broader need for [better trust infrastructure for the personalised web](/little-guys).

I'm very easily interested in people and problems. So if you have one, or if you are one, [say hi](mailto:smtp@arjun.md)!

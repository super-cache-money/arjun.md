### Hey!

I'm Arjun (Khoosal). Here's a little about me :)

### I'm on a sabbatical after a decade on my startup

I dropped out of uni ([bioinformatics research](https://scholar.google.co.za/citations?hl=en&user=UGUQ_WsAAAAJ)) to build [Kandua](kandua.com/-/about), which we sold to South Africa's biggest insurer. We built probably-too-many-products to get these guys jobs and run their businesses. Unfortunately, they still stand outside hardware stores.

All 50+ of us were so bought in to the mission. I loved that. I especially loved doing it all with [my cofounder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayo-folawiyo-4919b160/?originalSubdomain=uk). I did whatever felt most pressing (engineering, then also product).

### I want to dabble on fun problems with people

I'm most interested in LLMs, and Making The World A Better Placeâ„¢. Currently, this kind of stuff:
- [Private, portable LLM memory](https://asterisk.chat)
- [AI assisted journalling](https://arjunkhoosal.notion.site/Conversational-Journal-Mock-release-1b22e4fe580280678f02f954ecf3226d?source=copy_link)
- [A better way to trust code](/trust)

But it doesn't stop there. I'm easily interested in people and problems. So if you have one, or if you are one, [say hi](mailto:hi@arjun.md)!
